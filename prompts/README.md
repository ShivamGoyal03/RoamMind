# Detailed Agent Prompt Repository

This repository contains a detailed prompt for agents, inspired by the concepts presented in the [Microsoft AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners/tree/main/02-explore-agentic-frameworks) project. It summarizes the key ideas from the "Explore Agentic Frameworks" section into a comprehensive prompt.

## Overview

- **Core Concept:**  
  The detailed prompt is based on the agentic frameworks introduced in the Microsoft AI Agents for Beginners project. It serves as an educational resource for understanding how agents can be structured and operated.

- **Core Logic:**  
  The implementation leverages the core logic from the [RoamMind](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal03/RoamMind) code repository.

- **Customization:**  
  Users are free to modify and adapt this prompt to suit their own requirements. This repository is designed to be flexible and extensible for educational experiments.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Review the Microsoft AI Agents for Beginners Repository:**
